# Final Project Phase 1 Proposal 

## Problem 

The highest prevalence of HCV infection is present in Egypt, with 92.5% of patients infected with genotype 4, 3.6% patients with genotype 1, 3.2% patients with multiple genotypes, and < 1% patients with other genotypes. Grading the Virus has an impact on the treatment given to the patient this is where Machine Learning Steps in.

## Dataset 

Recorded by Ain Shams University, this [Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Hepatitis+C+Virus+%28HCV%29+for+Egyptian+patients) provides records of patients who underwent treatment dosages for HCV about 18 months. Data consists of 29 Attributes and 1385 instances. The Target Variable is a Discretized grade of the patient's infection degree.

## Proposed Methodology 

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Exploring the data for potential problems, cleaning and preparing
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploring the Data for Insightful Characteristics 
3. **Prototyping**: Instantiate a basic Model from potential ML Algorithms and find best Candidates
4. **Feature Engineering and Fine Tunning**: Given the Data Exploration find the best correlating features and tune the model to it's best performance.
